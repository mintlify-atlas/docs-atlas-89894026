<Warning>
We are currently **NOT accepting feature PRs** while we build out the core editor. If you want to contribute:

1. Open an issue first to discuss your idea
2. Wait for maintainer approval
3. Only then start coding

Critical bug fixes may be accepted on a case-by-case basis.
</Warning>

Thank you for your interest in contributing to OpenCut! This document provides guidelines and instructions for effective contributions.

## What to focus on

To make your contributions as effective as possible, focus on these areas:

### Good areas to contribute

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Timeline functionality" icon="timeline">
    Timeline UI improvements, track management, element manipulation
  </Card>
  <Card title="Project management" icon="folder-open">
    Project creation, loading, organization, and metadata
  </Card>
  <Card title="Performance" icon="gauge-high">
    Optimizations, lazy loading, code splitting, rendering improvements
  </Card>
  <Card title="Bug fixes" icon="bug">
    Fixing issues in existing functionality
  </Card>
  <Card title="UI/UX improvements" icon="paintbrush">
    Interface refinements, accessibility, responsive design
  </Card>
  <Card title="Documentation" icon="book">
    Code comments, guides, examples, API documentation
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Areas to avoid

<Warning>
Please **avoid** contributing to these areas for now:

- **Preview panel enhancements** - Text fonts, stickers, effects, overlays
- **Export functionality** - Export formats, quality settings, rendering
- **Preview rendering optimizations** - Canvas rendering, preview performance
</Warning>

**Why?** We're planning a major refactor of the preview system. The current preview renders DOM elements (HTML), but we're moving to a **binary rendering approach** similar to CapCut. This ensures:

- Consistency between preview and export
- Better performance and quality
- More accurate representation of final output

The current HTML-based preview is essentially a prototype. The binary approach will be the production system. To avoid wasted effort, please focus on other areas until this refactor is complete.

If you're unsure whether your idea falls into the preview category, ask in [Discord](https://discord.gg/zmR9N35cjK) or create a GitHub issue!

## Getting started

Before contributing, ensure you have your development environment set up.

<Card title="Development Setup" icon="wrench" href="/development/setup">
  Follow the setup guide to get your local environment running
</Card>

## Contribution workflow

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open an issue">
    Before starting work, open an issue to discuss your proposed changes:

    - **Bug fixes:** Describe the bug, steps to reproduce, and expected behavior
    - **Features:** Explain the use case, benefits, and implementation approach
    - **Improvements:** Detail what you want to improve and why

    Wait for maintainer feedback and approval before proceeding.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Fork and clone">
    Fork the repository to your GitHub account and clone it locally:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/opencut.git
    cd opencut
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create a feature branch">
    Create a descriptive branch name:

    ```bash
    # For features
    git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name

    # For bug fixes
    git checkout -b fix/bug-description

    # For improvements
    git checkout -b improve/what-you-improve
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Make your changes">
    Make your changes following the code style guidelines below.

    <Tip>
    Commit frequently with clear, descriptive commit messages that explain the "why" behind changes, not just the "what".
    </Tip>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Test your changes">
    Ensure your changes work as expected:

    - Test the functionality manually
    - Run existing tests: `bun test`
    - Add new tests if applicable
  </Step>

  <Step title="Lint and format">
    Run linting and formatting from the `apps/web` directory:

    <CodeGroup>
      ```bash Bun
      cd apps/web
      bun run lint
      bunx biome format --write .
      ```

      ```bash npm
      cd apps/web
      npm run lint
      npx biome format --write .
      ```

      ```bash pnpm
      cd apps/web
      pnpm run lint
      pnpm exec biome format --write .
      ```
    </CodeGroup>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Commit your changes">
    Write clear, concise commit messages:

    ```bash
    git add .
    git commit -m "fix: resolve timeline element selection bug"
    ```

    Use conventional commit prefixes:
    - `feat:` - New feature
    - `fix:` - Bug fix
    - `improve:` - Enhancement to existing feature
    - `refactor:` - Code refactoring
    - `docs:` - Documentation changes
    - `test:` - Test additions or changes
    - `chore:` - Build process or tooling changes
  </Step>

  <Step title="Push and create a pull request">
    Push your branch and create a pull request:

    ```bash
    git push origin feature/your-feature-name
    ```

    On GitHub:
    1. Navigate to your fork
    2. Click "Compare & pull request"
    3. Fill out the pull request template completely
    4. Link any related issues
    5. Request review from maintainers
  </Step>

  <Step title="Address feedback">
    Respond to review comments and make requested changes:

    ```bash
    # Make changes based on feedback
    git add .
    git commit -m "address review feedback"
    git push origin feature/your-feature-name
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Code style

OpenCut uses [Biome](https://biomejs.dev/) for code formatting and linting.

### Formatting rules

- **Indent style:** Tabs
- **Line width:** 80 characters
- **Quote style:** Double quotes
- **Semicolons:** Required

### Running code quality tools

From the `apps/web/` directory:

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash Check linting
  bun run lint
  ```

  ```bash Fix linting issues
  bun run lint:fix
  ```

  ```bash Format code
  bun run format
  ```
</CodeGroup>

From the project root:

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash Check linting
  bun lint:web
  ```

  ```bash Fix linting issues
  bun lint:web:fix
  ```

  ```bash Format code
  bun format:web
  ```
</CodeGroup>

### Code patterns

#### Use the actions system for user operations

```typescript
import { invokeAction } from '@/lib/actions';

// Good - uses action system
const handleSplit = () => invokeAction("split-selected");

// Avoid - bypasses UX layer
const handleSplit = () => editor.timeline.splitElements({ ... });
```

#### Use the useEditor() hook in components

```typescript
import { useEditor } from '@/hooks/use-editor';

// Good
function TimelineComponent() {
  const editor = useEditor();
  const tracks = editor.timeline.getTracks();
  return <div>{tracks.length} tracks</div>;
}

// Avoid - use useEditor() instead
function TimelineComponent() {
  const editor = EditorCore.getInstance();
  // ...
}
```

#### Follow directory conventions

- **`lib/`** - Domain-specific logic (actions, commands, video processing)
- **`utils/`** - Generic helper functions that could work in any app
- **`services/`** - External service integrations
- **`components/`** - React components

## Pull request guidelines

### PR title format

Use conventional commit format:

```
feat: add timeline zoom controls
fix: resolve playback position sync issue
improve: enhance timeline performance
```

### PR description

Fill out the pull request template completely:

1. **Summary** - Brief description of changes
2. **Motivation** - Why are these changes needed?
3. **Changes** - Detailed list of what changed
4. **Testing** - How did you test these changes?
5. **Screenshots** - For UI changes, include before/after screenshots
6. **Related issues** - Link to related issues using `Closes #123` or `Relates to #456`
