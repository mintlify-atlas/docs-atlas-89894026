OpenCut provides a complete project management system that stores all your work locally in your browser. Projects include your timeline, media assets, settings, and edit history.

## Creating projects

### New project

Start a new video project:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Click New Project">
    From the home screen, click the "New Project" button or use the keyboard shortcut.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Enter project name">
    Give your project a descriptive name (e.g., "Summer Vacation 2024" or "Product Demo").
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Start editing">
    Your new project opens with a default main scene and empty timeline, ready for content.
  </Step>
</Steps>

Each new project starts with:
- One main scene named "Main scene"
- Default canvas size (1920x1080)
- Default frame rate (30 fps)
- Default background color (black)
- Empty timeline with no tracks

## Saving projects

### Auto-save

OpenCut automatically saves your work:

- Saves occur after every editing action
- Saves are throttled to avoid performance issues
- A save indicator appears when saving
- All data is stored locally in your browser

<Info>
Your work is saved automatically. There's no "Save" button because you never need it.
</Info>

Source: `apps/web/src/core/managers/save-manager.ts`

### Manual save

While auto-save handles most situations, you can force a save:

- Close the project - triggers a final save and thumbnail update
- Exit the editor - ensures latest changes are persisted

Source: `apps/web/src/core/managers/project-manager.ts:170-191`

## Managing projects

### Project library

Access all your projects from the home screen:

- **Recent projects** appear first
- Each project shows:
  - Thumbnail preview
  - Project name
  - Duration
  - Last modified date
- Click any project to open it

Source: `apps/web/src/core/managers/project-manager.ts:197-215`

### Searching projects

Find projects quickly:

1. Use the search box in the project library
2. Type any part of the project name
3. Results filter in real-time
4. Clear the search to see all projects

Source: `apps/web/src/core/managers/project-manager.ts:471-502`

### Sorting projects

Organize your project library:

| Sort option | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| **Date (newest)** | Most recently modified first |
| **Date (oldest)** | Oldest projects first |
| **Name (A-Z)** | Alphabetical by name |
| **Name (Z-A)** | Reverse alphabetical |
| **Duration (longest)** | Longest projects first |
| **Duration (shortest)** | Shortest projects first |

Source: `apps/web/src/core/managers/project-manager.ts:471-502`

### Renaming projects

Change a project's name:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Access options">
    Right-click the project card or click the menu icon.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Choose rename">
    Select "Rename" from the menu.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Enter new name">
    Type the new name and press Enter or click Save.
  </Step>
</Steps>

The project's updated timestamp changes when renamed.

Source: `apps/web/src/core/managers/project-manager.ts:259-299`

### Duplicating projects

Create a copy of an existing project:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Select project(s)">
    Right-click a project or select multiple projects.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Choose duplicate">
    Click "Duplicate" from the menu.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Copy created">
    A new project is created with the name "(2) Original Name" format.
  </Step>
</Steps>

Duplicates include:
- Complete timeline and all edits
- All media assets
- All scenes and settings
- Independent copy (changes don't affect original)

Source: `apps/web/src/core/managers/project-manager.ts:301-425`

<Note>
Duplicate numbering is smart. If you duplicate "(2) Project Name", the new copy becomes "(3) Project Name".
</Note>

### Deleting projects

Remove projects you no longer need:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Select project(s)">
    Right-click a project or select multiple projects.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Choose delete">
    Click "Delete" from the menu.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Confirm deletion">
    Confirm the deletion in the dialog that appears.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
Deleted projects cannot be recovered. This action is permanent.
</Warning>

Deleting removes:
- The project and all its data
- All uploaded media assets for that project
- All edit history
- All scenes and settings

Source: `apps/web/src/core/managers/project-manager.ts:217-249`

## Project settings

Configure project-level settings:

### Canvas size

Set the output resolution:

- **1920x1080** (Full HD) - Default
- **1280x720** (HD)
- **3840x2160** (4K)
- **Custom dimensions**

Changing canvas size affects:
- Preview window dimensions
- Export resolution
- Element positioning (scaled automatically)

### Frame rate (FPS)

Set the playback and export frame rate:

- **24 fps** - Film standard
- **30 fps** - Default, web standard  
- **60 fps** - Smooth motion

Source: `apps/web/src/constants/project-constants.ts`

### Background

Choose what appears behind your content:

- **Solid color** - Single color background
- **Transparent** - For overlays and compositing
- **Image** - Custom background image

Source: `apps/web/src/core/managers/project-manager.ts:427-443`

## Data storage

### Where projects are stored

OpenCut uses browser storage:

- **IndexedDB** for project data and metadata
- **Local storage** for preferences
- All data stays on your device
- Nothing is sent to external servers

<Info>
Your privacy is protected. OpenCut is completely offline-capable and stores all data locally.
</Info>

### Storage limits

Browser storage limitations:

- Most browsers allow several GB of storage
- Quota depends on available disk space
- You'll be warned if storage is running low
- Consider exporting and deleting old projects

Source: `apps/web/src/services/storage/service.ts`

### Migrations

OpenCut automatically updates project data format:

- When you open an old project, it migrates to the latest version
- Migration progress is shown for large projects
- Original data is preserved during migration
- Migrated projects work with the latest features

Source: `apps/web/src/services/storage/migrations/index.ts`

## Best practices

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Use descriptive names" icon="tag">
    Name projects clearly so you can find them later (e.g., "Client Q4 Promo" not "Video 1").
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Duplicate before major changes" icon="copy">
    Create a duplicate before trying risky edits or major restructuring.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Delete old projects" icon="trash">
    Regularly remove completed or abandoned projects to free up storage space.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Export finished projects" icon="download">
    Once a project is complete and exported, consider deleting it to save space.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Troubleshooting

### Project won't load

If a project fails to load:

1. Refresh the browser
2. Clear browser cache
3. Check available storage space
4. Try opening a different project

Source: `apps/web/src/core/managers/project-manager.ts:120-168`

### Storage quota exceeded

If you run out of storage:

1. Delete old or unused projects
2. Export projects and remove source media
3. Clear browser cache and data
4. Use browser settings to increase quota (if available)

### Missing media assets

If media assets don't load:

- Assets are tied to specific projects
- Deleting a project removes its media
- Re-import media if needed

Source: `apps/web/src/core/managers/media-manager.ts`
