## Creating tracks

### Automatic track creation

The easiest way to create tracks is by adding content:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Select content">
    From the Assets panel, choose a video, audio, text, or sticker element.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Drag to timeline">
    Drag the element to an empty area of the timeline.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Drop to create">
    Drop above or below existing tracks to automatically create a new track of the appropriate type.
  </Step>
</Steps>

A visual indicator shows where the new track will be created.

### Manual track creation

You can also create empty tracks:

1. Right-click in the track area
2. Choose "Add Track" from the context menu
3. Select the track type

Source: `apps/web/src/core/managers/timeline-manager.ts:37-41`

## Track management

### Track controls

Each track has controls displayed in the track label area:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Mute control (Video & Audio tracks)">
    Click the volume icon to mute/unmute all audio in the track:
    - 🔊 Volume icon - Track is audible
    - 🔇 Muted icon (red) - Track is muted
    
    Muting a track affects all elements within it.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Hide control (Video, Text & Sticker tracks)">
    Click the eye icon to show/hide all visual elements in the track:
    - 👁 Eye icon - Track is visible
    - 👁‍🗨 Hidden icon (red) - Track is hidden
    
    Hidden tracks are not included in the final render.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Track type icon">
    Shows the type of content in the track:
    - 🎬 Video track
    - 🔊 Audio track  
    - 📝 Text track
    - ⭐ Sticker track
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

Source: `apps/web/src/components/editor/panels/timeline/index.tsx:278-305`

### Reordering tracks

Change the visual stacking order by dragging elements between tracks:

1. Click and hold an element
2. Drag vertically to another track
3. Drop to move the element

<Info>
Video, text, and sticker tracks stack in visual layers. Higher tracks appear on top of lower tracks in the preview.
</Info>

### Deleting tracks

Remove a track and all its contents:

1. Right-click on the track
2. Select "Delete track" from the context menu
3. The track and all its elements are removed

<Warning>
Deleting a track cannot be undone with Ctrl+Z. Elements in the track are permanently deleted.
</Warning>

### Element visibility and audio

Control individual elements within tracks:

- **Mute element** - Select element(s) and use the keyboard shortcut or properties panel
- **Hide element** - Select element(s) and use the keyboard shortcut or properties panel

These controls work independently from track-level mute/hide settings.

Source: `apps/web/src/core/managers/timeline-manager.ts:283-300`

## Track rendering order

### Visual layering

For video, text, and sticker tracks, the stacking order determines what appears on top:

- **Top tracks** render on top of lower tracks
- Elements with higher **opacity** are more visible
- **Blend modes** affect how layers composite together

Source: `apps/web/src/services/renderer/scene-builder.ts`

### Audio mixing

All audio tracks and video elements with audio are mixed together:

- Audio plays simultaneously from all unmuted tracks
- Individual element **volume** controls affect the mix
- Track-level **mute** disables all audio in that track

Source: `apps/web/src/lib/media/audio.ts`

## Main track

Every scene has one **main video track**. This track:

- Determines the project's base dimensions
- Appears with a red indicator in development mode
- Cannot be deleted (must have at least one video track)

Source: `apps/web/src/lib/timeline/index.ts`

## Best practices

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Organize by content type" icon="layer-group">
    Keep similar content on dedicated tracks (e.g., all background music on one audio track, all titles on one text track).
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Use track mute/hide" icon="eye-slash">
    Quickly toggle entire tracks on/off when working on specific parts of your edit.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Layer strategically" icon="layer-plus">
    Place foreground elements on higher tracks and backgrounds on lower tracks for easier management.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Test audio mix" icon="volume-up">
    Use track and element mute controls to isolate and balance different audio sources.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>
