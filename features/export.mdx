OpenCut provides powerful export capabilities that render your timeline to video files you can share, upload, or use in other applications.

## Export basics

### Starting an export

Export your project to a video file:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Click Export button">
    Click the blue "Export" button in the top-right corner of the editor.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Configure settings">
    Choose format, quality, and audio options in the export dialog.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Start export">
    Click "Export" to begin rendering your video.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Wait for completion">
    Watch the progress bar as your video renders. This may take several minutes depending on project length and quality.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Download file">
    When complete, the video file downloads automatically to your default downloads folder.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Export formats

OpenCut supports two video formats:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="MP4 (H.264)" icon="film">
    **Best for compatibility**
    
    - Most widely supported format
    - Works on all devices and platforms
    - Better compatibility with video editors
    - Slightly larger file size
    - Recommended for most use cases
    
    **Use when:** Sharing videos, uploading to social media, or importing into other software.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="WebM (VP9)" icon="video">
    **Best for file size**
    
    - More efficient compression
    - Smaller file sizes
    - Open source codec
    - Limited compatibility on older devices
    - Great for web playback
    
    **Use when:** Optimizing for web delivery or when file size is critical.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Quality settings

Choose the quality level that balances file size and visual quality:

| Quality | Bitrate | Use case | File size |
|---------|---------|----------|----------|
| **Low** | Lowest | Preview exports, quick drafts | Smallest |
| **Medium** | Moderate | General sharing, social media | Balanced |
| **High** | High | Recommended for most projects | Larger |
| **Very High** | Highest | Maximum quality, archival | Largest |

<Info>
**High quality** is the default and recommended for most projects. It provides excellent visual quality while keeping file sizes reasonable.
</Info>

Source: `apps/web/src/types/export.ts:1-6`

### Quality vs. file size

Understanding the tradeoffs:

- **Higher quality** = Better visual fidelity, larger files, longer upload times
- **Lower quality** = Faster exports, smaller files, visible compression artifacts
- **Very High** is best for archival or when you'll re-encode later
- **Medium** is often sufficient for social media (platforms re-encode anyway)

Source: `apps/web/src/services/renderer/scene-exporter.ts:29-36`

## Export options

### Frame rate

The export uses your project's frame rate setting by default:

- **24 fps** - Film look, smaller file size
- **30 fps** - Standard for web video
- **60 fps** - Smooth motion, larger file size

You can override the frame rate during export if needed.

Source: `apps/web/src/types/export.ts:16`

### Audio

Control whether audio is included:

- **Include audio** (default) - Exports video with all audio tracks mixed
- **Mute audio** - Exports silent video (video only)

<Note>
If your project has no audio tracks or all audio is muted, the audio toggle has no effect.
</Note>

Audio export includes:
- All unmuted audio tracks
- Audio from video elements (unless muted)
- Proper volume levels and mixing
- Synchronized to video frames

Source: `apps/web/src/components/editor/export-button.tsx:89-91`

## Export process

### Rendering stages

Exports happen in multiple stages:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Audio preparation (if enabled)">
    Creates the audio buffer by mixing all audio sources.
    
    Progress: 0-5%
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Scene building">
    Constructs the render tree from your timeline.
    
    Progress: 5-10%
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Video encoding">
    Renders each frame and encodes to video format.
    
    Progress: 10-95%
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Finalizing">
    Combines video and audio into final file.
    
    Progress: 95-100%
  </Step>
</Steps>

Source: `apps/web/src/core/managers/renderer-manager.ts:89-184`

### Progress tracking

Monitor export progress:

- **Progress bar** shows percentage complete
- **Current percentage** displayed numerically
- Export runs in the background (don't close the browser tab)
- You can cancel anytime by clicking "Cancel"

Source: `apps/web/src/components/editor/export-button.tsx:257-277`

### Canceling exports

Stop an export in progress:

1. Click the "Cancel" button during export
2. The export stops immediately
3. No file is downloaded
4. You can start a new export with different settings

Canceled exports don't create partial files.

Source: `apps/web/src/core/managers/renderer-manager.ts:149-165`

## File naming

Exported files are named automatically:

- Uses your project name
- Adds the file extension (`.mp4` or `.webm`)
- Invalid characters are replaced with hyphens
- Example: `"My Summer Vacation"` → `My-Summer-Vacation.mp4`

Source: `apps/web/src/components/editor/export-button.tsx:134`

## Snapshot exports

Capture a single frame as an image:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Position playhead">
    Move the playhead to the frame you want to capture.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Take snapshot">
    Use the snapshot feature (camera icon or keyboard shortcut).
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Download image">
    The frame is exported as PNG and downloads immediately.
  </Step>
</Steps>

Snapshot features:
- Always exports at project canvas resolution
- PNG format for lossless quality
- Filename includes timecode (e.g., `Project-00-01-23-15.png`)
- Perfect for thumbnails or social media posts

Source: `apps/web/src/core/managers/renderer-manager.ts:26-87`

## Troubleshooting exports

### Export failed

If an export fails:

1. Check the error message in the export dialog
2. Click "Copy" to copy the error details
3. Click "Retry" to try again
4. Common causes:
   - Browser ran out of memory
   - Missing media files
   - Corrupted project data

Source: `apps/web/src/components/editor/export-button.tsx:293-337`

### Slow exports

Export speed depends on:

- **Project length** - Longer videos take more time
- **Quality setting** - Higher quality = slower encoding
- **Computer performance** - Faster CPU = faster exports
- **Project complexity** - More tracks and effects slow down rendering
- **Format** - WebM/VP9 encoding is slower than MP4/H.264

<Tip>
For very long projects, consider exporting overnight or during lunch breaks.
</Tip>

### Large file sizes

If exported files are too large:

- Try a lower quality setting (High → Medium)
- Consider WebM format for better compression
- Reduce project resolution in settings
- Lower the frame rate if smooth motion isn't critical

### Missing audio

If exported video has no audio:

- Check that "Include audio" is enabled
- Verify audio tracks aren't muted
- Ensure video elements with audio aren't muted
- Check volume levels (very low volume may seem silent)

Source: `apps/web/src/lib/media/audio.ts`

## Best practices

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Test with low quality first" icon="gauge">
    Export a quick Low quality version to check timing and edits before waiting for a High quality render.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Use High quality for finals" icon="star">
    The High quality setting provides excellent results for most use cases without excessive file sizes.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Choose MP4 for compatibility" icon="check">
    When in doubt, use MP4 format. It works everywhere and is widely supported.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Don't close browser during export" icon="window-close">
    Keep the browser tab open while exporting. Closing it will cancel the export.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Export defaults

Default export settings:

```typescript
{
  format: "mp4",      // MP4 (H.264)
  quality: "high",    // High quality
  includeAudio: true  // Audio enabled
}
```

Source: `apps/web/src/constants/export-constants.ts:3-7`

These defaults provide a good balance of quality, compatibility, and file size for most projects.
