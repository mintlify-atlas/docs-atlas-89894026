OpenCut's timeline editor provides a powerful interface for arranging and editing your video content. The timeline supports multiple tracks, precise playback control, and frame-accurate editing.

## Timeline overview

The timeline is divided into several key areas:

- **Ruler** - Shows time markers and allows you to navigate through your project
- **Bookmarks row** - Add markers and notes at specific points in your timeline
- **Track area** - Contains all your video, audio, text, and sticker tracks
- **Track labels** - Shows track controls (mute, hide, track type icons)
- **Playhead** - Indicates the current playback position

## Playback controls

### Play and pause

Control playback using the play/pause button or keyboard shortcuts:

- Press `Space` or `K` to play/pause
- Playback automatically stops when reaching the end of your timeline
- If the playhead is at the end, pressing play will reset to the start

## Editing operations

### Splitting elements

OpenCut provides three split operations:

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Split" icon="scissors">
    Cuts element(s) at the playhead position, keeping both sides.
    
    **Shortcut:** `S`
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Split left" icon="align-left">
    Cuts and removes everything before the playhead.
    
    **Shortcut:** `Q`
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Split right" icon="align-right">
    Cuts and removes everything after the playhead.
    
    **Shortcut:** `W`
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

The split operation works on all selected elements. If nothing is selected, it splits all elements under the playhead.
