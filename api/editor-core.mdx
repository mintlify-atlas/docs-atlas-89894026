title: EditorCore
description: The main singleton class that manages all editor functionality
---

## Overview

EditorCore is the central singleton that coordinates all editor functionality through specialized manager instances. It follows the singleton pattern to ensure only one editor instance exists at a time.

## Architecture

The EditorCore provides access to specialized managers:

- `playback` - Controls video playback and seeking
- `timeline` - Manages tracks and timeline elements
- `scenes` - Handles scenes and bookmarks
- `project` - Manages project lifecycle and settings
- `media` - Handles media asset storage
- `renderer` - Controls video rendering and export
- `command` - Provides undo/redo functionality
- `save` - Manages auto-save behavior
- `audio` - Controls audio playback
- `selection` - Tracks selected elements

## Usage

### In React components

Always use the `useEditor()` hook in React components. The hook automatically subscribes to state changes and triggers re-renders:

```tsx
import { useEditor } from '@/hooks/use-editor';

function MyComponent() {
  const editor = useEditor();
  const tracks = editor.timeline.getTracks();

  return <div>{tracks.length} tracks</div>;
}
```

### Outside React components

Use `EditorCore.getInstance()` directly in utilities, event handlers, or non-React code:

```typescript
import { EditorCore } from "@/core";

const editor = EditorCore.getInstance();
editor.playback.play();
```

<Warning>
Do not use `EditorCore.getInstance()` inside React components. Always use the `useEditor()` hook to ensure proper reactivity.
</Warning>

## Methods

### getInstance()

Returns the singleton EditorCore instance, creating it if it doesn't exist.

```typescript
static getInstance(): EditorCore
```

**Returns**

- `EditorCore` - The singleton editor instance

**Example**

```typescript
const editor = EditorCore.getInstance();
```

### reset()

Resets the singleton instance. Used primarily for testing.

```typescript
static reset(): void
```

<Warning>
This method destroys the current editor instance. Only use this in test environments.
</Warning>

## Properties

All manager properties are readonly and initialized when the EditorCore instance is created:

### command

Manages undo/redo command history.

```typescript
readonly command: CommandManager
```

### playback

Controls video playback state and seeking.

```typescript
readonly playback: PlaybackManager
```

See [PlaybackManager API](/api/playback-manager) for details.

### timeline

Manages timeline tracks and elements.

```typescript
readonly timeline: TimelineManager
```

See [TimelineManager API](/api/timeline-manager) for details.

### scenes

Handles scenes and bookmarks.

```typescript
readonly scenes: ScenesManager
```

See [ScenesManager API](/api/scene-manager) for details.

### project

Manages project lifecycle, settings, and metadata.

```typescript
readonly project: ProjectManager
```

See [ProjectManager API](/api/project-manager) for details.

### media

Handles media asset storage and retrieval.

```typescript
readonly media: MediaManager
```

See [MediaManager API](/api/media-manager) for details.

### renderer

Controls rendering and video export.

```typescript
readonly renderer: RendererManager
```

### save

Manages auto-save behavior and dirty state tracking.

```typescript
readonly save: SaveManager
```

### audio

Controls audio playback and mixing.

```typescript
readonly audio: AudioManager
```

### selection

Tracks currently selected timeline elements.

```typescript
readonly selection: SelectionManager
```
