  <Accordion title="Your privacy matters" icon="lock">
    Unlike cloud-based editors, OpenCut processes everything locally. Your videos, projects, and edits never touch our servers. You maintain complete control over your content.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="No more paywalls" icon="money-bill-slash">
    Most basic features in popular editors like CapCut are now locked behind subscriptions. OpenCut gives you professional editing tools without the price tag.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Simplicity is key" icon="sparkles">
    Complex editors like DaVinci Resolve and Premiere Pro are powerful but overwhelming. OpenCut focuses on the features most people actually use, making video editing accessible to everyone.
